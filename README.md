## Introduction

This project implements a credit scoring system using fuzzy logic. It aims to provide a tool for evaluating the creditworthiness of individuals based on their financial and environmental factors. The system takes into account variables such as net income, age, employment status, housing situation, and other relevant data.

By utilizing fuzzy logic techniques, the project offers a flexible and interpretable approach to credit scoring that can be adapted to various scenarios and environments.

## Features

- Calculates net annual income considering factors such as marital status, children's ages, and other revenues.
- Evaluates environmental factors using fuzzy logic, determining whether the client's environment is favorable, uncertain, or unfavorable.
- Integrates net income and environmental factors to determine the client's creditworthiness (bad, uncertain, or good).
- Provides a simulation environment to test different scenarios and input parameters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository using:

   ```bash
   git clone [git clone https://github.com/akshitaadhikari/Fuzzy_Logic_Credit_Evaluation.git](https://github.com/akshitaadhikari/Fuzzy_Logic_Credit_Evaluation.git)

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Credit-Scoring-using-Fuzzy-Logic

3. Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -U scikit-fuzzy numpy matplotlib


## Usage

1. Open the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Credit-Scoring-using-Fuzzy-Logic

2. Run the credit scoring simulation:

    ```bash
    python credit_scoring_simulation.py

3. Follow the prompts to input relevant data and parameters for the simulation.
4. View the simulation results and the client's credit status.
